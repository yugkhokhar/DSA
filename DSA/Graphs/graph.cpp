// DIRECTED GRAPH ARE THE GRAPH WITH DIRECTED EDGES 
// UNDIRECTED GRAPH ARE THE GRAPH THAT DTERMINE THE NO OF POSSIBLE NEIGHBOUR [ADJACENT EDGES]

//DEGREE OF A VERTEX ARE OF TWO TYPE: INDEGREE: NO OF INCOMING EDGES
//OUTDEGREE: NO OF OUTGOING EDGES


//CONNECTED AND DISCONNECTED GRAPH: GRAPHS IN  WHICH EVERY NODE HAS A  PATH FROM OTHER NODE
//DISCONNECTED GRAPH: IN THIS EVERY NODE DO NOT HAVE FROM A OTHER NODE

//CONNVECTED COMPONENTS ARE THE CONNECTED GRAPHS IN A UNCONNECTED COMPONENTS

//CYCLIC AND ACYCLIC GRAPHS: THE GRAPHS WHICH CONTAIN CYCLE IN ITAND THE GRAPH THAT DO NOT CONTAIN CYCLE

//TREE IS A CONNECTED ACYCLIC GRAPH
//PROPERTIES: 1. NO OF EDGES: N-1  2. NO CYCLES 3. EVERY NODE HAS A PATH FROM OTHER NODE

//DAG (DIRECTED ACYCLIC GRAPH) 1: IT IS A DIRECTED  2: CYCLE NOT PRESENT

//COMPLETE GRAPH : THE GRAPH IN WHICH EVERY NODE IS CONNECTED TO OTHER NODES IN A GRAPH
//PROPERTIES: THE NO OF EDGES IN A COMPLETE GRAPH IS nC2

//WEIGHTED GRAPH IS A GRAPH WITH WEIGHT ON ITS EDGES

//NO OF EDGES IN A GRAPH WITH N VERTEX=N-1
